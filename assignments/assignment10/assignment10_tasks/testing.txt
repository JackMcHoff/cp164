Question: How does the efficiency of the Gnome Sort compare to 
 Insertion Sort and Selection Sort?
Answer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insertion Sort has a Big O complexity of O(n^2) 
 Source: https://bohr.wlu.ca/cp164/notes/L15.php
Selection Sort also has a Big O complexity of O(n^2) 
 Source: https://bohr.wlu.ca/cp164/notes/L15.php
Since Gnome Sort is similar to both selection and insertion sort
 it should have a similar Big O time complexity
Gnome Sort goes through the entire list in the worst case scenario and
 thus it is O(n^2)
Therefore, gnome sort is similar to insertion and selection sort
